# Bar Chart

In this project I create a bar chart to display the growth of the United States GDP (Gross Domestic Production) from 1947 to 2015.
This is a project from the freeCodeCamp course and I made it using the D3.js library.


## How to clone the app locally...

Clone the git repository in the folder of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/m-onofri/bar_chart.git
```

Go inside the **bar_chart** folder and open the **index.html** file in your favorite browser.


## ...or watch it live!

You can have a look at this app [here](https://m-onofri.github.io/bar_chart/).


## Main features

* In this project I used D3.js version 5.
* The x-axis is a time scale representing the year from 1947 to 2015.
* The y-axis represents the GDP amount express in billion dollars.
* You can mouse hover a bar and see a tooltip which displays more information about that specific bar.


## Cross-browser consistency 

The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.
